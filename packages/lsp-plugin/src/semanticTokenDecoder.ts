 * from a server that simply sent fewer tokens — which is how a legend ends up two thirds on the
 * floor while everything looks like it is working.
 *
 * The decoder neither aggregates nor logs. Whether these are summed per server, reported once per
 * session, or ignored is the host's policy, on the host's side of the seam: this package does not
 * know what a session is, or which server answered.

/**
 * Turns an LSP semantic-tokens response into absolute spans with names on them.
 *
 * This is the one decoder. It lives in this package rather than in the editor because it is on the
 * *request* side of the seam — it runs on the host's schedule, against the host's legend, and the
 * editor's paint layer never sees a legend or a 5-tuple. A second implementation anywhere is a
 * defect: the relative cursor below is stateful, and its rejection rules are the kind that produce
 * plausible wrong offsets rather than exceptions. A copy that drops an out-of-legend tuple without
 * advancing the cursor corrupts every span after it and still paints something.
 *
 * Five rules, each of which exists because a real server violates it:
 *
 * 1. **Decode by index. Never invert the legend into a name-to-index map.** Real legends ship the
 *    same name at several indices — one server ships `variable` at three and `function` at two — and
 *    an inverted map silently mis-decodes every duplicate.
 * 2. **An out-of-legend `tokenTypeIndex` drops the tuple but still advances the cursor.**
 * 3. **Modifier bits beyond the legend's length are ignored, not errors.** The bitset is 32 bits
 *    wide and a legend may declare six.
 * 4. **Zero-length tuples are dropped.** They cannot paint and they are common in the wild.
 * 5. **Every offset is clamped to the document length**, and a tuple that begins past the end of
 *    the text it addresses — `deltaLine` past the last line, or `character` past the end of the
 *    line it reached — is dropped rather than throwing. Only the *start* is held to the line: an
 *    `end` beyond it is a multi-line span, which is a thing this decoder emits on purpose.
 *
 * Offsets come out absolute, in UTF-16 code units, which needs no encoding conversion at all: the
 * client declares `general.positionEncodings: ['utf-16']`, UTF-16 code units are JavaScript string
 * indices, and the editor's paint APIs take offsets.
