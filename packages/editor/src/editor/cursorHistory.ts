 * Where the carets have been, recorded apart from the document's own history.
 *
 * Retracing a jump and taking back an edit are different intents, and a user
 * asking for one must never be handed the other — so this stack holds no edits
 * and the caller drops it whole the moment the text changes. Offsets recorded
 * against text that has since moved would put the carets somewhere that no
 * longer means anything, and no partial rescue of them beats starting over.
 *
 * Scroll travels with each entry because the position a jump was made from is
 * as much where the reader was looking as where the caret sat; restoring only
 * the caret leaves them somewhere they never were.
