# Tree-sitter Syntax System

## Decision

Tree-sitter is the first-party structural syntax engine, delivered through the optional `@singapor/tree-sitter` runtime plugin. Core editing remains plain when no syntax provider is registered. Shiki remains available as an optional highlighter package for hosts that prefer it.

Tree-sitter provides a single structural model for:

- syntax highlighting through highlight queries
- folds
- structural selection expand/shrink
- bracket and tag matching
- indentation
- language injections
- outline-style symbol extraction
- future semantic decorations and code-intelligence hooks

## Core Invariant

The piece table remains the canonical document model. A Tree-sitter parse is a derived projection over one `PieceTableSnapshot`.

Selections are stored as anchors, not Tree-sitter nodes. Tree-sitter can create, expand, shrink, and classify selections, but the resulting ranges must cross the API boundary as anchor-backed ranges.

This preserves correctness when:

- parsing is stale
- syntax is temporarily invalid
- no grammar exists for the file
- edits arrive faster than worker parsing
- undo/redo switches snapshots
- multi-cursor selections cross syntax boundaries

## Worker Ownership

Tree-sitter is owned by the optional runtime package and runs behind a syntax backend. The default backend is a local browser worker. Parser creation, grammar loading, parsing, incremental reparsing, query execution, injected-language parsing, and syntax-tree traversal all run off the main thread.

The main thread may render syntax results, but it must not synchronously parse or query during typing. It should only consume compact, snapshot-tagged worker outputs:

- highlight decorations
- fold ranges
- structural-selection ranges
- indentation hints
- bracket/tag match ranges
- outline or symbol summaries

Each parse result is tied to a document snapshot/version. Consumers must be able to reject syntax results whose base snapshot is older than the visible document state.

## Incremental Parse Pipeline

1. Worker receives an edit batch against snapshot `S`.
2. Piece table produces snapshot `S+1`.
3. The syntax system translates the edit batch into Tree-sitter input edits.
4. Tree-sitter incrementally reparses against `S+1`.
5. Queries run for invalidated or visible ranges first.
6. Query results are emitted as syntax decorations or structural ranges tagged with their base snapshot.

Open implementation details:

- exact Tree-sitter input adapter for piece-table reads
- websocket backend protocol beyond the local worker backend
- parser package loading policy for third-party language plugins
- query asset format beyond raw highlight/fold/injection query strings
- cancellation or superseding behavior for stale parses

The current parsed snapshot retention, source chunk accounting, and worker restart policy are
recorded in [Worker Topology](../architecture/worker-topology.md#tree-sitter-syntax-worker).

## Highlighting

Tree-sitter highlight queries are the long-term source of syntax highlighting.

Highlight output should be represented as dense decorations with offsets or line-scoped ranges. It must not allocate an anchor per token. The renderer may continue using the CSS Highlight API, but the source of ranges should be Tree-sitter query output.

## Structural Selection

Structural selection is syntax-driven and anchor-backed.

Examples:

- select smallest named node at cursor
- expand to containing expression/block/function/class
- shrink through the previous expansion stack
- select sibling node or list item
- select Tree-sitter leaf/token range

The selection model stores `SelectionSet<Anchor>`. Tree-sitter nodes are transient helpers for
computing the next selection range.

Structural-selection commands normalize the set before sending ranges to the backend, then derive
both request order and source metadata from that same normalized sequence. Returned ranges retain
the source selection's id, direction, and affinity. The result is normalized honestly rather than
being marked normalized by construction; when backend ranges converge, expansion stacks are rebound
to the surviving selection ids and their tops are aligned with the normalized ranges. A result-count
mismatch is stale rather than a partially paired response.

## Folds

Fold ranges should be derived from Tree-sitter queries where a grammar is available. Manual folds and fallback indentation folds can coexist, but syntax folds are the primary path.

Fold ranges should cross into the display transform layer as anchor-backed ranges so FoldMap remains snapshot-aware.

## Injections

Language injections are part of the syntax system, not a separate tokenizer path.

Injected parse trees must retain parent snapshot identity and produce highlights/decorations in buffer coordinates so rendering and selection stay unified.
