# Browser Quirks

Browser-specific workarounds in the editor. Every workaround in the code gets an
entry here: the user-visible symptom, the root cause, the chosen fix and why, a
minimal repro, and the upstream bug. Keep entries dated with the engine versions
they were verified against, so they can be re-tested and removed when upstream
fixes ship.

Related inline workarounds already documented at their call sites:

- `packages/editor/src/style.css` — `will-change: transform` on virtualized rows
  (WebKit re-resolves registered CSS Highlight ranges when a painted row's
  transform changes).

## Safari renders every line number as "0"

**Verified 2026-06 against:** WebKit 26.4 (Playwright webkit-2272) — broken;
Chromium 147, Firefox 148 — correct. Upstream: [WebKit bug 308446
"Counters evaluation with style containment"](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=308446),
open at time of writing.

### Symptom

In Safari the line-number gutter shows `0` for every row. Chromium and Firefox
show correct line numbers.

### How line numbers are rendered

The line gutter does not write digits into the DOM. Each gutter cell carries an
inline `counter-set: editor-line <n>` (`packages/gutters/src/lineGutter.ts`),
and the digits are painted by CSS:

```css
.editor-virtualized-line-number::before {
  content: counter(editor-line, var(--editor-line-gutter-counter-style, decimal));
}
```

This is deliberate: pseudo-element text stays out of text selection and the
clipboard, there is no per-scroll text-node churn when recycled rows are
renumbered, and the `counterStyle` plugin option lets consumers swap numbering
via any `@counter-style` name without JS formatting.

### Root cause

The virtualizer merges the `editor-virtualized-gutter-cell` class onto the very
element the gutter contribution returns from `createCell`
(`packages/editor/src/virtualization/virtualizedTextViewRows.ts`,
`createGutterCell`). That class used to apply `contain: layout paint style`.

WebKit mis-scopes CSS counters under style containment: when the **same
element** has `contain: style` and a `counter-set`, the counter is not visible
to that element's own `::before`, so `counter()` falls back to `0`. Per
[css-contain](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-contain/#containment-style), style
containment scopes counter properties to the element's subtree — which includes
its own pseudo-elements — and Chromium and Firefox render it that way.

The failure needs both halves on one element. Style containment on
*ancestors* of the counter-carrying element works fine in WebKit, which is why
only the gutter cell (and not the row/root containment) ever broke.

### Repro matrix

Minimal repro, WebKit-only failure on the marked rows:

```html
<style>
  .num::before { content: counter(editor-line); }
  .lps { contain: layout paint style; }
  .lp  { contain: layout paint; }
</style>
<span class="num lps" style="counter-set: editor-line 42"></span> <!-- WebKit: 0 -->
<span class="num" style="counter-set: editor-line 42; contain: style"></span> <!-- WebKit: 0 -->
<span class="num lp" style="counter-set: editor-line 42"></span> <!-- 42 everywhere -->
<span class="lps"><span class="num" style="counter-set: editor-line 42"></span></span> <!-- 42 everywhere -->
```

Also verified unaffected: dynamic CSSOM assignment (`el.style.counterSet`),
post-paint value mutation, `hidden` toggling, `var()` as the `counter()` style
argument, and the full root > row > cell containment chain — WebKit handles all
of those once the counter-carrying element itself has no style containment.

### Fix

`.editor-virtualized-gutter-cell` uses `contain: layout paint`, dropping
`style` (`packages/editor/src/style.css`). Layout and paint containment carry
the actual virtualization wins; style containment on a leaf cell only scoped
counters/quotes — and the only counters in play are exactly the ones it broke.
Rows and the editor root keep full `layout paint style` containment.

Rejected alternatives:

- **Wrap the counter in a child span** — an extra DOM node per mounted row per
  contribution, purely to dodge the bug.
- **Write digits via `textContent`** — puts line numbers back into
  selection/clipboard reach, adds text-node updates on every remount/renumber,
  and drops `@counter-style` support.

### Contract

Anything returned from a gutter contribution's `createCell` gets the cell class
merged onto it. Do not re-add `contain: style` (or `contain: strict`/
`content-visibility`, which imply it) to gutter cell elements that rely on CSS
counters.

## Firefox paints syntax highlights from a stale snapshot

**Verified 2026-06 against:** Firefox 148 — broken (intermittent, user-confirmed
persistent in long-lived sessions); Chromium 147, WebKit 26.4 — correct.
**Upstream:** no matching report existed when this was added (closest resolved
cousins: [Bug 2035083](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2035083)
"CSS highlights not rendering on inserted text nodes",
[Bug 1984991](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1984991) highlight
invalidation on style changes). File a new report once a standalone repro
exists; see "Reproduction status" below.

### Symptom

After scrolling (confirmed) and likely edits, Firefox renders token colors that
do not match the text: identifiers in the wrong color, later-registered
override buckets (function/builtin colors) losing to the base identifier
bucket, and single tokens split across two colors mid-word.

### Evidence chain

The decisive observation, captured live from a broken session:

- Dumping every range over the broken rows (`CSS.highlights` registry) showed
  **fully correct state** — clean token boundaries, correct style buckets,
  correct `::highlight()` rules, correct registration order.
- The screen disagreed with that registry — including a token covered by
  exactly one registered range that painted in **two different colors**, which
  no combination of the live ranges and rules can express.
- Re-registering every registry entry (order-preserving delete + set) from the
  console **instantly fixed the paint** without touching any range.

Conclusion: the registered ranges are right; Gecko paints `::highlight()` from
a stale internal snapshot after a burst of Highlight mutations over recycled
text nodes (virtualization rewrites `textNode.data` in place, then swaps that
row's `StaticRange`s — see `virtualizedTextViewRows.ts`).

### Workaround

`packages/editor/src/virtualization/geckoHighlightRepaint.ts`:
`scheduleHighlightRepaintNudge()` re-registers every registry entry,
order-preserving, coalesced per registry through a microtask so a mutation
burst costs one re-register and the rebuild lands before the next paint (no
broken frame, unlike rAF scheduling). Gecko is detected by feature
(`'MozAppearance' in documentElement.style`), and the nudge is a no-op
elsewhere. It is scheduled from every highlight mutation primitive: token row
rebuilds, token range deletion on row release, token clears, and find/
diagnostic range highlight updates — so every trigger (scroll recycling,
typing, folds, tab switches) is covered by construction rather than by
enumerating triggers.

Order preservation matters: overlap winners between equal-priority highlights
follow registry order (base identifier bucket vs. function/builtin override
buckets), so the nudge must not reorder entries.

### Reproduction status

Not yet reproducible on demand: 23 scripted scroll-storm sessions against the
real app reproduced it at most once, and isolated repros (in-place `data`
mutation + StaticRange swap, hidden-during-recycle, transform moves,
containment wrappers) all paint correctly in Firefox. The trigger appears to
involve shared-bucket churn (token buckets being released and re-minted as
documents open/close) interleaved with row recycling. A standalone repro for
the upstream report should simulate two editors sharing highlights, one
churning acquire/release while the other recycles rows.

### Related

Eagerly mounted background tabs tokenize and register highlight ranges without
ever being activated. That multiplies shared-bucket churn (and wastes work);
reducing it shrinks this bug's trigger surface.
