/**
 * The documented overlay-mode limit, held down here so it cannot rot into folklore.
 *
 * `injectedTextDisplayRow` gives an injected row `startOffset === endOffset`
 * (displayTransforms.ts:887-888). Downstream, `rangeSegments` returns `[]` for
 * `row.source === 'injected'` (virtualizedTextViewGeometry.ts:398) and `textOffsetFromDomBoundary`
 * returns null (virtualizedTextViewRows.ts:2508), so an injected row has no geometry to draw a
 * selection against and no offset to map a click onto.
 *
 * Token painting is the exception, and not in overlay mode's favour. Chunk offsets are derived as
 * `rowStartOffset + localIndex`, not from the row's `endOffset`, so the degenerate-range bail at
 * virtualizedTextViewHighlights.ts:759,:805 never fires — and the injected row is painted with
 * whatever tokens live at `[anchorOffset, anchorOffset + text.length)` in the *document* buffer.
 * Those are some following document line's tokens, not the deleted line's. Overlay deletions are
 * not uncoloured; they are miscoloured, which is the worse of the two.
 *
 * What the three cases below assert is deliberately what is *observable*, not what is merely true.
 * Selection painting is not: happy-dom has no layout, so no selection highlight registers for any
 * row, injected or not, and an assertion about it would discriminate nothing. Copy is asserted
 * through the editor's own selection model rather than a DOM Range, because `handleCopy` reads
 * `resolvedSelections()` (inputSelectionController.ts:2468, :2945) and never consults
 * `document.getSelection()` — a hand-built DOM range proves nothing about either.
 *
 * This is the counter-test to test/documentMode.test.ts. It is what makes the M0 gate falsifiable,
 * and it is the citation to point at (plan R4) when someone proposes collapsing the two modes into
 * `overlay`. If it starts failing, injected rows changed shape and §C2 needs rewriting — establish
 * what the new behaviour is before touching the assertions.
