/**
 * The one regression test for a cross-package agreement nothing else enforces.
 *
 * `Highlight.priority` is a single document-global namespace that five subsystems write into from
 * four packages, and priority only decides between highlights that declare the *same* property —
 * the CSS Custom Highlight API resolves per property. So the only real contest is for `color`, and
 * exactly five producers declare one:
 *
 * | producer                   | priority | why it sits there                                   |
 * | -------------------------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
 * | syntax token highlights    | 0        | the colour everything else refines                  |
 * | `BRACKET_COLOR_Z_INDEX`    | 1        | replaces the grammar's colour on a bracket glyph     |
 * | the semantic token layer   | 2        | refines both; must not hide an error                 |
 * | `DIAGNOSTIC_STYLES.error`  | 3        | a problem outranks a shade of meaning                |
 * | `FIND_CURRENT_STYLE`       | 6        | an answer to a question the user just asked          |
 *
 * Bracket depth colouring is the one this table used to omit, and it sat on the semantic layer's
 * number. Nothing painted wrong, because no semantic scope covers a bracket glyph today — which is
 * exactly what makes an omission like that survive: it is latent until a host writes one
 * `scopeAliases` entry mapping a server's `brace` onto a scope the theme colours. An enumeration
 * that is only accidentally complete is what this file exists to stop.
 *
 * Before this ordering was declared, the error style carried no `zIndex` at all and sat at 0
 * alongside every token highlight — so whether an error's red text survived over a syntax-coloured
 * identifier came down to which style key the document's shared registry had seen first, which is a
 * function of session history rather than of anything anyone chose.
 *
 * The assertions below read the real values from the three packages rather than restating them,
 * because a test that restated them would go on passing while the thing it guards drifted.
